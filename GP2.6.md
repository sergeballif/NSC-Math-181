# Guided Practice 2.6: Derivatives of inverse functions

## Overview

The goal of this section is to develop derivative rules for the functions $y = \ln(x)$, $y = \arcsin(x)$, and $y = \arctan(x)$. These are very important functions in their own rights, and they are all defined as **inverses** of existing functions. The fact that they are inverse functions provides a one-size-fits-all method for determining their derivatives. We will briefly review the basic precalculus concepts about inverse functions and then see how the definition of an inverse function -- in addition to the Chain Rule -- leads to these three derivative rules as well as a general rule for differentiating *any* inverse function.


## Learning objectives

__Basic objectives__: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks _prior_ to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below).

- (*Review*) State the basic facts about inverse functions given on pages 130--131.
- (*Review*) State the definition of the natural logarithm, arcsine and arctangent functions.
- (*Review*) Calculate basic values of the natural logarithm, arcsine, and arctangent functions without a calculator. (For example, $\ln(e^5)$ and $\arcsin (1/2)$.)
- State the derivative of the natural logarithm function.
- Explain the derivation of the derivative of $\ln x$ which is presented in full on page 131--132.
- State the derivative of the arcsine function.
- Explain the derivation of the derivative of $\arcsin x$ which is presented in full on page 134--135.
- State the derivative of the arctangent function.

__Advanced objectives__: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student _during_ and _following_ class discussions.

- Mimic the derivative of the arcsine function derivative to build a differentiation rule for the arctangent function.
- Differentiate functions involving the natural logarithm, arcsine and arctangent functions.
- Solve problems in context that involve the natural logarithm, arcsine and arctangent functions.
- If $g$is the inverse of a differentiable function $f$,  give a general formula for the derivative of $g$ in terms of the derivative of $f$.

## Learning resources

To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following.

__Textbook__: In _Active Calculus_, read Section 2.6. Make sure to read actively, working through examples and activities as you go.

__Video__: There are two sets of videos to watch this time. The first set is review about inverse functions from precalculus mathematics, and runs a total time of about 35 minutes. I would recommend at least reviewing these videos for all students, and students who need a refresher course on inverse functions should give full attention to all of them. The second set is the core calculus material for this section, and each student should watch all of the videos (running time 14:24).

## Activities

The following activity is to be done _during_ and _following_ your reading and viewing of the resources. Go to [student.desmos.com](https://student.desmos.com/?prepopulateCode=VRJ5VW) and join using your name in the format `Last, First`. For example, I would enter my name as `Ballif, Serge`. Complete each part of the activity. Some of these problems will require you to work them out on paper before entering your answer. Practice producing high quality work so that your work is readable and meaningful. You will receive a mark of __Pass__ if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline. __Remember to use the Piazza discussion board to ask about any questions you have.__
