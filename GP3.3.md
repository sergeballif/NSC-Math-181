# Guided Practice for 3.3: Global optimization

## Overview

One of the most important applications of calculus to authentic real-world problems is optimization, or finding the "best" value of a function. We've already touched on this idea in Section 3.1 by describing how to use derivatives to find maximum and minimum values of a function. But we also saw that it's possible for a function *not* to have an absolute (or "global") maximum or minimum value. In this section, we will be discussing situations in which functions *do* have global extreme values -- namely, when the function is continuous and defined only on a closed interval -- and describe a simple method for how to find these extrema.



## Learning objectives

__Basic objectives__: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks _prior_ to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below).

- (Review) Explain the difference between a *global* maximum or minimum and a *local* maximum or minimum.
- Explain what the **Extreme Value Theorem** says and enumerate the three-stage process outlined in that theorem for finding the global extreme values of a function on a closed interval.

__Advanced objectives__: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student _during_ and _following_ class discussions.

- Given a continuous function on a closed interval, find the global extreme values of the function.
- Apply the process of global optimization to an applied setting.

## Learning resources

To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following.

__Textbook__: In _Active Calculus_, read Section 3.3. Make sure to read actively, working through examples and activities as you go.

__Video__: Watch the following videos at the MTH 201 YouTube playlist (http://bit.ly/GVSUCalculus).

## Activities

The following activity is to be done _during_ and _following_ your reading and viewing of the resources. Go to [student.desmos.com](https://student.desmos.com/?prepopulateCode=WWPGRE) and join using your name in the format `Last, First`. For example, I would enter my name as `Ballif, Serge`. Complete each part of the activity. Some of these problems will require you to work them out on paper before entering your answer. Practice producing high quality work so that your work is readable and meaningful. You will receive a mark of __Pass__ if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline. __Remember to use the Piazza discussion board to ask about any questions you have.__
