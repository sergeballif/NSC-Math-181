# Guided Practice for 3.5: Related Rates

## Overview

This section introduces a new kind of derivative problem called a related rates problem. In a related rates problem, we are given a relationship between two or more quantities and the rates of change of all but one of those quantities, and then we find the rate of change in the remaining quantity. For example, in an electrical circuit, voltage, current, and resistance are related by the formula V = IR. If we know the rate at which voltage and resistance are changing with respect to time, we might want to find the rate at which current is changing with respect to time. Therefore this is an application in particular of implicit differentiation to real-world scientific problems and problems in other areas.

## Learning objectives

__Basic objectives__: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks _prior_ to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below).

- Read a quantitative problem carefully and identify the independent and dependent variables in the problem as well as the constraints on the variables.
- Explain what a “related rates” problem is. (Hint: See the **Overview** above.)
- Identify when more than one variable in a problem depends on a common third variable, such as when multiple variables depend on time.
- In the context of a related rates problem, identify the rate of change you wish to find and use implicit differentiation/Chain Rule to take the derivative.


__Advanced objectives__: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student _during_ and _following_ class discussions.

- Set up and solve related rates problems using calculus.

## Learning resources

To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following.

__Textbook__: In _Active Calculus_, read Section 3.5. Make sure to read actively, working through examples and activities as you go.

__Video__: Watch the following videos at the MTH 201 YouTube playlist (http://bit.ly/GVSUCalculus).

## Activities
Complete the activity [here](https://student.desmos.com/?prepopulateCode=j72rg). Then proceed.

The following activity is to be done _during_ and _following_ your reading and viewing of the resources. Go to [student.desmos.com](https://student.desmos.com/?prepopulateCode=HHNQGM) and join using your name in the format `Last, First`. For example, I would enter my name as `Ballif, Serge`. Complete each part of the activity. Some of these problems will require you to work them out on paper before entering your answer. Practice producing high quality work so that your work is readable and meaningful. You will receive a mark of __Pass__ if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline. __Remember to use the Piazza discussion board to ask about any questions you have.__
