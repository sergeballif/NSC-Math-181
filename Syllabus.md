## Quick Grade Summary

Except for the WeBWorK HW, all of the work in the course will be graded on a __PASS__/__NO PASS__ basis. The [Schedule](index.html) tells when outside work is due and the [Specifications](Specifications.html) give the details on how to get a checkmark.

The rest of the syllabus explains more details about what these categories are.

## Course Materials
__Textbook:__ _Active Calculus_ by Matt Boelkins et al. This is a free PDF download at
[http://gvsu.edu/s/xr](http://gvsu.edu/s/xr) or webpage at [http://faculty.gvsu.edu/boelkinm/Home/AC/index.html](http://faculty.gvsu.edu/boelkinm/Home/AC/index.html). If you would like a print copy, see the link at the bottom of that page. We will be working through Sections 1.1--5.3 of this textbook.
__Video materials:__ All course pre-lectures are on a YouTube playlist at [http://bit.ly/GVSUCalculus](http://bit.ly/GVSUCalculus).
__Software:__ The course uses three software tools:

* [Canvas](http://nsc.instructure.com) is the course management system where our course home page is hosted.
* [Desmos](https//desmos.com) , a free program for graphing functions and building models. Guided Practice assignments will be completed using Desmos.
* WeBWorK is our online homework system. WeBWorK can be accessed using the link in the left-hand menu of our Canvas course.


## Assigned Work
The work you do in the course has two purposes: To help you make sense of the concepts you are supposed to know, and to assess how well you have mastered the learning objectives of the course. These items of work include:

* __Guided Practice:__ These are structured activities that guide you (by questions that you answer) through reading, viewing, and other preparatory activities on new content.
* __WeBWorK Homework:__ For each section there will be about a dozen homework problems to complete using WeBWorK.  These exercises focus on computational skill and basic conceptual  understanding and build upon your first contact with Calculus material you gain
through Guided Practice.
* __WeBWorK Journal:__ Students will record their work on WeBWorK homework problems following the specification guidelines.
* __Daily Quizzes:__ At the beginning of each class period where we begin lecture on a new section we will have a quiz to assess how well you have mastered the material of the previous day.
* __Miniprojects/Problems:__  The exams will test mastery of the 16 course learning objectives. Each of the exams will consist of problems that where student scan show mastery of the learning outcomes that were part of the chapter. In addition to the Problems, there are eleven miniprojects that involve a careful write-up of your solution. Most Miniprojects focus on real-world applications and the use of real-world data and, especially, the use of technology to model and solve problems involving calculus.
Three of the miniprojects ask students to take on the role of teacher by creating lessons that show that they have mastered the material and are able to communicate it in a thorough and efficient way to an audience of their classmates. These teaching Miniprojects are of three types.
  - __Texting Lesson__ Students can create a mock question-and-answer session where a teacher teaches the students one of the core lessons of the class.
  - __Video Lesson__ The student will create a screencast video (or some other type of lesson video) summarizing one of the sections of the book.
  - __Desmos Activity__ Students will create a Desmos account at [https://teacher.desmos.com](https://teacher.desmos.com) and create a lesson activity that illustrates one of the core objectives of the class.

__Grading System__
Math 181 uses a **points-free mastery-based grading system** that is designed to provide you with control over the grading process, transparency as to your progress toward a course grade, and a final course grade that truly reflects your actual mastery of course concepts. Our grading system works as follows:

* At the beginning of the semester, you will be asked to decide on the target grade you plan to earn for the course. This does not need to be an “A”. You’ll be asked to carefully consider your goals, skill set, life situation, academic needs, and so on before stating your target grade. For some students, a “B” or even a “C” is perfectly sufficient and realistic, relative to their situation.
* **The means of assessing your graded work in the class is done without using points**. Instead, your work is graded on a two-level scale of **Pass/No Pass**. Whenever you submit work to be graded, I will employ my best professional judgment along with a clear list of specifications for categorizing that work. The specifications for your work are provided in a separate page, and you should make yourself intimately familiar with that document. Each Guided Practice, WeBWorK Homework, WeBWorK Journal, and Daily Quiz, Problem, and Miniproject will be graded on a Pass/No Pass basis.
* The grade you earn at the end of the semester is determined by counting the number of items in each category that you __PASS__. There are no points involved and no statistical or numerical calculations.

The table for determining your grade is given below. For reference: there are a total of 27 problems and miniprojects, 27 daily quizzes, 28 guided practice assignments, and 140 points of online homework. See the [Specifications for Student Work](NSC-Math-181/Specifications.html) page to see what it means to obtain a __PASS__.

It might be easier to visualize the grading system as a collection of checkmarks

__Plus/Minus grading:__ In case not all of your attainments in the class are at the same grade level, we will figure plus/minus grades as follows. Note there are five overall categories of work you will do: Guided Practice, Daily Quizzes, Problems/Miniprojects, WeBWorK HW, and WeBWorK HW Journals.  First, find your category at which you have attained the lowest level of work. If that is the only category at this level, you will receive a “minus” grade for the next level up. If there are two categories at the lowest level you will receive a “plus” grade. Otherwise (more than two categories at that lowest level) you will receive the grade of your lowest level.

* Example: A student who has passed 23 Guided Practice assignments (B level), 17 Daily Quizzes (C level), scored 140 points on WeBWorK (A level), passed 3 WeBWorK Journals (A level), passed 5 Miniprojects (B level), and passed 12 exam problems (B level) receives a **B-** since the lowest grade was a C while all the others were at a higher level.

* Example: A student who has passed 23 Guided Practice assignments (B level), 25 Daily Quizzes (A level), scored 132 points on WeBWorK (A level), passed 3 WeBWorK Journals (A level),passed 5 Miniprojects (B level), and passed 15 exam problems (A level) receives a **B+** since the lowest grade was a B, but there were only two grades at that level.

Please note that NSC does not award grades of A+ or D-.

__Revisions:__ Instead of partial credit, you will receive numerous opportunities to revise and resubmit work that does not meet the specifications for Passing. Specifically:

* Online homework gives instant feedback on correctness when you submit it. **You are allowed unlimited reattempts on every online homework item** until the due date.
* **Each Daily Quiz can be attempted twice without penalty** (an initial attempt + one reattempt in my office). Further reattempts can be “purchased” using tokens (see below).
* Problems are assessed on Midterm and Final exams.  If you fail to __PASS__ a learning outcome on the exam, then you can attempt that problem type on the last day of class in the Bonus Final. Once you __PASS__ enough problems for the grade you want, you can opt out of the exams. It’s not uncommon for many students not to take the Final exam or Bonus Final because they have already “leveled up” to their target grade by the time of the exam.
* **Any miniproject submission that does not attain a PASS level can be revised and resubmitted for regrading at the expense of a token.**
*
_Note_: Guided Practice assignments may not be revised or submitted late. These must be completed at the stated deadline or they receive a permanent __No Pass__.

__Tokens:__ Each student will be given 5 “tokens” at the beginning of the term. Each token can be cashed in for one of the following:  

* A revision of a Miniproject that was assessed as a __No PASS__ (within one week of receiving the grade).
* A revision of a WeBWorK journal (within one week of receiving the grade)
* A third attempt of a Quiz (within a week of taking the first quiz).
* A 24-hour extension on any Miniproject or WeBWorK set. If you choose to use a token for a deadline extension, you must inform me prior to the original deadline. Submissions given after the extended deadline are not accepted.  

Opportunities to earn additional tokens may be given during the semester.

__Notes about this grading system:__ The advantages of this grading system are numerous:

* It focuses course work away from point-scoring, which is counterproductive to learning, and focuses instead on whether or not your work meets professional quality standards.
* It places control of your grade firmly in your hands so that you don’t have to “hope” for a grade.
* It directly links the grade you earn to the amount and quality of work that you do.
* It gives a final grade that communicates real information about your mastery of the subject.
* Finally, it allows you to be graded on what you eventually master, so that early missteps do not have to have a major negative future impact.

The chief downside to this system is that it’s complicated. You can download my [sample gradebook](assets/images/Math181GradebookSp18.xlsx) to track your progress through the course to help make it easier. And if you have any questions or concerns about the system, please let me know.

## What are the consequences of missing class?

If you miss class you will miss out on the daily quiz. The quiz will only be given to students in class; you will need to use one of your tokens if you want to take a quiz outside of class. If you miss class, then you will also miss out on the lecture and activities. One possible way to catch up on the material that was covered during class is to watch the lecture recording which can be accessed by clicking on the YuJa tab in Canvas. However, you should only think of the recorded lecture as a backup because there are occasionally technical problems.

Note that the style of this class is a partially flipped class, so you will do much of your learning by reading and watching videos outside of class. Much of each class period will be devoted to applying the principles and practicing the techniques that will be acquired in the out-of-class reading. You probably don’t want to miss out on the classroom discussion and activities. If you must miss class, then be sure to complete the Guided Practice prior to class.
